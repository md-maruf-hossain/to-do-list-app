# To-Do-App

A simple Todo List application using React. The application will allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Additionally, tasks
will have a status (completed or incomplete). Each task will also have a priority (low/ medium/ high). Each priority will have its own color which will indicate the
taskâ€™s priority in the tasklist. The application should display tasks in an organized manner and provide basic functionality to manage them.
